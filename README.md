# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game that involves uncovering a grid of squares without detonating hidden mines. Below are the basic rules of Minesweeper:

## Rules of Minesweeper

- **Objective**: The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on the grid that do not contain mines, without detonating any mines.

- **Game Grid**: The game is played on a rectangular grid of squares. The size of the grid and the number of mines are predetermined at the beginning of each game.

- **Mines**: Mines are hidden under some of the squares on the grid. The number of mines is displayed at the start of the game.

- **Uncovering Squares**: Players can open a square to uncover it. If a square containing a mine is uncovered, the game ends, and all mines are revealed.

- **Numbers**: If a square does not contain a mine, a number is revealed indicating the total number of mines in the adjacent squares (including diagonals).

- **Squares with zeros**: If a square with no adjacent mines is uncovered, it automatically reveals adjacent squares until a numbered square is encountered.

- **Marking Mines**: Players can mark squares they suspect contain mines by right-clicking (or using an alternate input method). Marked squares cannot be uncovered until the mark is removed.

- **Winning**: The game is won when all non-mine squares are uncovered.

- **Losing**: The game is lost if a mine is uncovered. The player can choose to start a new game after winning or losing.

## Strategy

Players use deduction and logic to uncover safe squares and flag potential mine locations. Remember that Minesweeper requires a combination of strategy and luck, and with practice, players can improve their ability to deduce the locations of mines based on the revealed numbers.
